# First-Flutter-App
I am on a journey to explore Flutter. As a beginner in cross-platform mobile application development—and someone who has never been particularly interested in mobile app development—I've found my interest growing since I took the first step in this area. I’m excited to complete and see the results of my very first Flutter app, which will be a simple project as I embark on this journey.
